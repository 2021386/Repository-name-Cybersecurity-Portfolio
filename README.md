Penetration testing report using Kali Linux, Nmap, Nessus, Metasploit, and Wireshark
This repository contains my penetration testing and vulnerability assessment project completed as part of my Network & System Security module.

The assessment includes reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, network attacks, analysis, and remediation using industry-standard cybersecurity tools.

**Tools Used**
Kali Linux
Nmap
Nessus
Metasploit Framework
Hydra / Medusa (bruteforce tools)
DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)
Ettercap (MITM attack)
Wireshark (packet analysis)
SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)

**Project Highlights**
**1. Reconnaissance & Scanning**
Port scanning
Service enumeration
OS fingerprinting
Tool: Nmap

**2. Vulnerability Assessment**
Automated vulnerability scanning
CVE identification
Severity analysis (High/Medium/Low)
Tool: Nessus

**3. Exploitation**
Tomcat Manager exploit
VNC authentication bypass
SQL Injection (manual & automated)
Command Injection
Tools: Metasploit, DVWA

**4. Password Attacks**
SSH login brute-force
Web login brute-force
Tools: Hydra, Medusa

**5. Network Attacks**
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack
HTTP/packet sniffing
Tools: Ettercap, Wireshark

**6. Social Engineering**
Credential harvesting attack
Tool: SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)

**7. Reporting & Remediation**
Full vulnerability documentation
Technical analysis of exploited weaknesses
Security hardening recommendations
Best practice fixes (patching, ACLs, strong auth, encryption)

**Files Included**
Penetration_Testing_Report.pdf
Full report including methodology, attack steps, evidence, and remediation.

**Learning Outcomes**
